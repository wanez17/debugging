# debugging
#This is a version narrowed down to make debugging easy.

#THINGS TO NOTE

// 1. When I provide an external webhook url, response gets sent

// 2. When I run webhook file directly on browser, response gets logged as expected.

// 3. Secret key is working and active

// 4. But when I run the tesy payment, nothing logs. (even after I turned off ModSecurity)
